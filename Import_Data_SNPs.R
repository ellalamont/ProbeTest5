# Importing data on SNPs for the phoP gene (Rv0757)
# H37Ra should have a SNP at this gene

# App is showing:
# Mutation from C -> T at 852263
# Since it starts at 851608, this is at position 655
# "one single nucleotide polymorphism affecting codon 219 (TCG → TTG) in phoP and changing a serine to a leucine. S219 in PhoP of M. tuberculosis is equivalent to R200 in PhoB of E. coli" - https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2238218/
